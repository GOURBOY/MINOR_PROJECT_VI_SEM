Daily rental: Tractor-trolleys are typically rented on a daily basis, and prices can range from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,500 per day depending on the location and type of equipment. Monthly rental: If you need a tractor-trolley for an extended period of time, you may be able to negotiate a monthly rental rate with the rental company. Monthly rates can range from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000 depending on the location and type of equipment. Delivery and pickup charges: Some rental companies may charge additional fees for delivering the tractor-trolley to your location and picking it up after the rental period is over. These fees can vary depending on the distance and location. Security deposit: Rental companies may also require a security deposit before renting out the equipment. This deposit is typically refundable at the end of the rental period, but the amount can vary depending on the rental company.

Sprayers Truck
Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 per month
On average, a basic sprayers truck can be rented in India for anywhere from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 per month, while a more advanced or larger capacity sprayers truck can cost upwards of Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 40,000 per month or more. However, these are just rough estimates, and actual rental prices may vary. If you are interested in renting a sprayers truck in India, I recommend doing some research on rental companies in your area, comparing features and rental prices, and reaching out to the rental companies for more information. Additionally, you may want to consider factors such as the rental terms and conditions, availability of spare parts and maintenance support, and insurance coverage when selecting a rental company.
